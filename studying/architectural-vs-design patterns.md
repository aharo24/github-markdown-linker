`architectural patterns:`
-   `Model-View-Controller (MVC):` A pattern used to separate the concerns of the data model, the user interface, and the control flow between them.
    
-   `Microservices:` A pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability.
    
-   Event-Driven Architecture: A pattern that organizes an application around the production, detection, and consumption of events.
    
-   Client-Server: A pattern that separates the concerns of the user interface and the data storage and management.
    
-   Layered Architecture: A pattern that organizes an application into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility, and defines strict interfaces between them.
    


`design patterns:`
-   `Singleton:` A pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    
-   `Factory:` A pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    
-   Decorator: A pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
    
-   Observer: A pattern that allows a number of observer objects to be notified of changes to the state of a subject object, without the subject and observer being tightly coupled.
    
-   Command: A pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, and the queuing or logging of requests.
