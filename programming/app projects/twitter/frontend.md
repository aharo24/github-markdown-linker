# Modal
A modal is a type of user interface component that appears on top of the main content and blocks user interaction with the rest of the page until the user takes action or dismisses it. It is commonly used to display additional information or to prompt the user to take a specific action, such as confirming a deletion or submitting a form.

In web development, modals are typically implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The modal is created as a separate HTML element with a higher z-index than the rest of the page, and is typically positioned in the center of the screen using CSS. The content of the modal can include text, images, and other user interface components, as well as event handlers to respond to user input.

When a modal is triggered, it is typically displayed using JavaScript code that sets its display property to "block" or "flex". The modal may include one or more buttons that allow the user to take an action, such as "Submit" or "Cancel". When the user takes an action or dismisses the modal, the JavaScript code typically sets its display property back to "none" to hide it and allow the user to interact with the rest of the page again.
