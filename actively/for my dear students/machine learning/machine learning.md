## Overview only see these if you become advance or contact me:
1.  Languages: Python is the most popular language for machine learning and has many powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis, such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib, as well as popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
    
2.  Tools: Jupyter Notebook is a popular tool for writing and sharing code in a readable format, and is widely used for machine learning projects. Additionally, tools such as Git, GitHub and Google Colab can be useful for version control, collaboration and cloud computing.
    
3.  Frameworks: Popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras, while popular computer vision frameworks include OpenCV and Pillow.
    
4.  Courses: Coursera, Udemy and edX all offer online courses in machine learning, as well as more specialized topics like deep learning and computer vision.
    
5.  Books: "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka and "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville are both widely considered to be good introductory books for machine learning.
    
6.  Practice: Participating in machine learning competitions on websites such as Kaggle is a great way to apply the concepts learned and improve skills.
